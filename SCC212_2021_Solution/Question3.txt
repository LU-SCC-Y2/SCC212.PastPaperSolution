Question 3 

3a. five most significant conceptual differences between Java and Python/JavaScript
    1. Need to define type in Java but not in Python/JavaScript
    2. The OOP concept in Java is more organized as it supports multi files, but harder in Python/JavaScript
    3. Java supports concurrency by using threads, but not JavaScript/Python 
    4. Java supports abstract classes and interfaces which makes the code more safe and extendible
    5. Java can support polymorphism easier, but harder in Python/JavaScript

3b. 1. Declaring Variables 
        JavaScript
        let a = 5; // mutable 
        const a = 5; // immutable 

        Java
        int a = 5; // type is specified and is mutable
        final String a = "abc" // type is specified and is immutable

    
    2. OOP 
        Python
            class Animal():
                def sound(self):
                    print("animal's sound")
        
        Java 
        public class Animal{
            public void sound(){
                System.out.println("animal's sound");
            }
        }
        then other classes can easily extend this Java class, even in other files

    3. concurrency 
        JavaScript // uses aync

        async function abc (){
            const reponse = await (console.log("hello word"));   
        }

        Java
        public synchronized void abc(){
            System.out.println("hello world");
        }

    4. Error Handling 
        Python 

        try(

        )catch(

        )

        Java
        try{

        } catch(Exception e){

        } // error could be more specific such as IOException

3c. I would join the Group A because it makes the code structure more organized by using multi files and packages
    throughout the development. It is also better in terms of team development as each team member can work on 
    different files.
